This is my first script for Roblox. 
With some assistance from my friend and my ideas, we were able to create a UI just for the game "White Room" on Roblox.
This is for convenient purposes only.


Loadstring: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NFMS-1/White-Room-UI/main/Source%20Code", true))()
